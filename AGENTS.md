## Project Vision

- Build a simple, personal blog hosted on GitHub Pages.
- Support multiple post formats: traditional blog posts, dev logs, casual musings, photo series, and more.
- Hand-code every page while reusing shared components or layouts whenever possible to keep maintenance manageable.
- Maintain a frictionless deployment flow: pushing to `main` should publish the latest version to GitHub Pages without extra steps.
